  photographer: Marianna Sgherri
  content: This photo was taken on the beach at Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon – also known as ‘diamond beach’ for obvious reasons! It was a real struggle to shoot anything here due to the weather, but I love the smooth texture of the clear chunk of ice in the foreground and Craig struggling against the wind in the distance. There’s some spray from the sea on my lens but in this instance, I think it works well.
