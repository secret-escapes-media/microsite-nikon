    quote: The biggest challenge in Norway, as photographers, was that we only had very limited light to play with. In late autumn, Lofoten only gets around six hours of light each day

    quote: Lofoten offers travellers so much variety, from windswept coast, to cosy cabins, to staggering peaks. Despite having been here many times before, I found it new and exciting once more

    quote: It was energising to see Jeryl’s excitement each day, the way his face lit up when the perfect light shard struck a nearby peak, or a rainbow appeared out of nowhere. Collaboration is easy when like minded people come together for a common goal

    quote: It was a mad experience shooting from such a high vantage point and being reminded how small we are in this vast landscape. It felt surreal to be a human drone for once

    quote: What more can one ask for having a local with a common interest in photography showing me the culture she’s so familiar with? It really helped me get the right shots
