  - title: Go mirrorless
    id: mirrorless
    content: Capture light like never before. With no mirror to worry about, the Nikon Z 7’s full-frame, 45.7 megapixel CMOS sensor is just 16mm from the lens mount; a lens mount that is also the world’s widest full-frame mount. That means more light is captured in every shot. Enjoy unrivalled optical quality and sensor quality in all lighting situations, with an ISO range that covers 64-25600 ISO – with minimal noise and astounding dynamic range.

  - title: Never miss the action
    id: speed
    content: Capture an astonishing 9 fps, with 493 focus points available; if you’re shooting something fast-moving, or something that just doesn’t want to play ball, you can be sure that your subject will be sharp and in focus all the time. No matter how quickly the decisive moment appears, in-camera five-axis optical Vibration Reduction (VR) compensates for camera shake in five directions. 4K video has never been steadier and stills, which can be captured as you film, never sharper.

  - title: Connect
    id: connect
    content: The larger Z mount gives unmatched optical and sensor quality, plus a new range of cutting-edge lenses. But that doesn’t mean you can’t use your existing Nikon lenses with the Z 7; the clever FTZ mount adaptor connects the gap between Nikon’s existing lens family and the advantages of this new Z mount. Connect your Nikon Z 7 even further with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, allowing you to quickly connect with a smart device and transfer JPEGs on the fly, or upload RAW files wirelessly to a computer.
