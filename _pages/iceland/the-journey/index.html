      <p class="text--lg">We landed bright and early in Reykjavik after a 2:30am start in London, but there was no time for sleep. Instead, we dropped our suitcases at the house and jumped back the car in search of Vik’s black volcanic beaches.</p>
      <p class="text--lg">When we arrived, the sky was 48 shades of grey and the wind was blustering. We had hoped to capture a sunset over Dyrholaey – a natural arch in a cliff that juts out to sea. Unfortunately, we couldn’t see the sun due to the low clouds but we did capture the drama of the beautifully bleak colour palette.</p>

      <p class="text--lg">Today, we donned our waterproofs to take on the south’s waterfalls. From our base near Hvolsvollur, we were only a short drive from Skogafoss – one of the Iceland’s biggest and most famous waterfalls. </p>
      <p class="text--lg">The golden sunrise that we caught a glimpse of as we left the house was soon replaced by familiar grey skies. After gulping down a takeaway coffee from the little food van in the car park, we set out to shoot one of the busiest waterfalls in the area, followed by a hidden gem that’s only a walk away from Skogafoss but far lesser known.</p>

      <p class="text--lg">This day started out as a bit of a disaster, our alarms were set for 5am to shoot a sunrise, but the weather had other ideas and we were rained off (not such a bad thing - we had a snooze and drank coffee by the fire instead).</p>
      <p class="text--lg">Later in the day, we decided to explore the local area around our house without any real plan in mind. This led us past a field with two friendly Icelandic horses and then on towards mountains and shimmering rivulets that covered the land like a spaghetti junction. While we were there, black clouds started to roll in behind the hills and we didn't see another soul for hours - it was a deserted, beautiful place to shoot and one that we just stumbled upon. Iceland tends to be like that...</p>

      <p class="text--lg">For our final day in Iceland, we made every minute count with a slightly painful 2am start and a three-and-a-half-hour drive to Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon. We piled in the cart with our pillows and camera equipment and drove in the pitch black, with rain beating down and a playlist on loud.<p>
      <p class="text--lg">Arriving at the glacier lagoon was a surreal experience, it wasn’t quite light yet and aside from a few campervans, we were there alone to see pale blue blocks of ice floating into one another in a placid lagoon. The reliably challenging weather blew us sideways and soaked us to the bone - you couldn’t even see where the sky ended and the water began. It felt like being on another planet, especially as next to the lagoon is a black sand beach, where lumps of ice wash up onto the shore and sparkle in the light as they melt.</p>
