expert-tips: >
  <p class="text--italic">“Here’s my checklist for any Icelandic adventure – waterproof clothes, good hiking shoes and a great camera. Plastic bags and elastics for the rain (there’s alot of rain!) and mists in the waterfalls helps protect your camera from water ingress.</p>
  <p class="text--italic">With the weather kept in check, I would recommend the following lenses: a wide-angle 14/24 f2.8, a mid-range 24/70 f2.8 and for zoom a 70/200. Wide, middle and long covers all your bases. The f2.8 isn’t strictly necessary, but for low-light conditions like caves or for capturing the Northern Lights it really soaks up the available light.</p>
  <p class="text--italic">Most of the iconic Icelandic locations get really busy, so get over there before the sun rises (sunset remains busy unfortunately). Don’t be afraid to check out the not-so-popular spots, they’re less documented making your photos more unique! Be ready to really explore the island, making a 4X4 nearly essential for the tougher spots. Most of all, keep your eyes open for cool stuff and have fun!”</p>

      <p class="text--lg">After a crack of dawn flight from London, we were eager to start our journey deep into Iceland’s wild landscape. </p>
      <p class="text--lg">We headed straight for Vik’s black volcanic beaches to capture the unique contrasting colours of this mystifying spot. In the same area is the famous Dyrhólaey peninsula – a natural arch in a cliff that juts out to sea. At sunset, this spot comes to life with the vast, dark ocean countering the golden light. When we arrived, the sky was typically grey and the wind was blustering high on the steep cliffs. This added to the drama, as we set about capturing Iceland’s beautifully bleak colour palette.</p>

  - title: Skógafoss

      <p class="text--lg">We set off to the south in search of waterfalls. Waterproofs were essential as we headed for Skógafoss – one of Iceland’s biggest and most famous waterfalls. A golden sunrise was quickly replaced by those familiar grey skies. Following a quick coffee stop, we arrived at this breathtaking location, only to discover another, more secluded sight just around the corner...</p>

  - title: Horses & Hills
    content: >
      <p class="text--lg">The Icelandic weather reared its grey head yet again. A 5am start to catch the sunrise was halted by rain showers. Instead, we decided to wander through the local area, with no real plan in mind. This led us past a field with two friendly Icelandic horses and then on towards mountains and shimmering rivulets that covered the land like a spaghetti junction. While we were there, black clouds started to roll in behind the hills and we didn't see another soul for hours – it was a deserted, beautiful place to shoot and one that we had simply stumbled upon...</p>

  - title: Jökulsárlón Lagoon

      <p class="text--lg">The day’s 2am start was essential for capturing the breathtakingly surreal landscape of the Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon. Three-and-a-half hours was spent driving through pitch-black darkness, with the rain driving down. Arriving at the glacier lagoon was a surreal experience, it wasn’t quite light yet and aside from a few campervans, we were there alone to see pale blue blocks of ice floating into one another in a placid lagoon. The reliably challenging weather blew us sideways and soaked us to the bone - you couldn’t even see where the sky ended and the water began. It felt like being on another planet, especially as next to the lagoon is a black sand beach, where lumps of ice wash up onto the shore and sparkle in the light as they melt.</p>
